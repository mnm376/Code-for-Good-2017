# Web-Application-for-Kevin-Bacon-s-Six-Degrees-Organization
A Prototype for Kevin Bacon's Six Degree Idea

This web application was made for sixdegrees.org in order to help Kevin Bacon and other catalysts in aiding campaigns and possibly starting their own.

A user goes to the home screen and enters their login credentials. Afterward successful sign in, the user gets taken to their dashboard where they can view current challenges from campaigns they joined, campaign invites from other catalysts, and current campaigns. Clicking on a campaign will take the user to a public dashboard of the campaign itself, where reports are given by creating aggregations from the database. 

The user also has the ability to create a new campaign. The page they are directed to create a new campaign is two fold. The first page asks about the name and info about campaign. Once they click submit, this creates an entry in the database with default challenges provided from the submit function. From there, the user can edit those challenges or remove as they please.
